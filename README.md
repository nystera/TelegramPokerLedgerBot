# TelegramPokerLedgerBot
THINGS TO DO:
- run it in express to do event listening rather than bot polling
- see if can integrate in group
- allow ledger to be considered completed or not
- setup DB to keep ledger history (not sure if we can just use the poker group to keep ledger history)
- ledger history should only include people in the group (maybe each of us have unique nicknames to always use)
- ledger history should only update when settled
